## What is an Invoice App?

An invoice app simplifies the often tedious task of generating invoices for products or services you provide. It's a valuable tool for businesses and freelancers, helping them maintain a professional image while efficiently managing their financial transactions. Here are some key features and functionalities of this Invoice App:

- **Invoice Creation**: You can easily create and customize invoices with details such as your business information, customer details, invoice items, and payment terms.

- **Save and Organize**: The app allows you to save your invoices securely and conveniently. It acts as a digital repository for all your invoices, making it simple to access past records.

- **PDF Generation**: One of the standout features is the ability to convert your invoices into PDF format. This is incredibly useful for sharing invoices with clients, vendors, or for your records. 

- **Authentication**: To ensure the security and privacy of your invoices, the app includes user authentication. This means you can control who has access to your invoices and other app features.

- **Firebase Integration**: Firebase, a powerful backend-as-a-service platform by Google, is used to store and manage your invoice data. It provides a robust and scalable database solution.

- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure user authentication. JWTs enable safe transmission of data between the app and the Firebase backend, ensuring that your data remains confidential.
